<H1>TRAVELLING IN DEPRESSION</H1>
<p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience</P>
<p>At five, I <strong>marveled</strong> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the 
thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in  
Starz<style=text:color:blue <strong>University.</strong><style>
</p>
<p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first 
became interested in language. 
It began with French, which taught me the importance of 
pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris 
where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it 
PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on 
the A, she looked at me be wildered. 
</p>
<p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and 
aware of its similarities with English through cognates. 
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks 
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to 
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish
